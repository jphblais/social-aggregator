# social aggregator
Aggregate your social API's content into one GraphQL call.

## Pupose
For me to learn GraphQL.  For my student contributor (DÃ©rek Falco), to learn JavaScript and modern web development.
For my website to be more dynamic with less maintenance (no more personal blog).

## Usage

### Start the Development Server
```Bash
npm start
```

When starting the server there are a couple of parameters you can pass:
* verbose - Enable verbose output
* release - Enable release mode, which will generally disable debugging features

Hot reloading is in place, so you do not need to restart the server on file change.

#### Environment Variables
The following environment variables are supported:
* PORT - defaults to 1234 if not set

### Deployment
If you want to deploy your application, simply copy the build folder and invoke
```Bash
node server.js
```

## Big Picture

1) Client Query content with a GraphQL Query
2) Social Aggregator service analyse Query and send parallel requests (2.*) to social services API's
3) Social services API's send back contents/responses (3.*)
4) Social Aggregator merge social contents into an unified content and send it to the client.
